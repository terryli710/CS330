These results align with my expectations, random method won't be able to learn from previous experiences, thus cannot improve in training, each time it's training from scratch. $RL^2$ should perform better and better through epochs as it stores previously learned data to fasten future learning. But the performance depends a lot on the initialization and is not stable.
